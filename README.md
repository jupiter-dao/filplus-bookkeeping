## Client Diligence

JupiterDao follows a comprehensive and structured client verification process:

1. **KYC/KYB Verification:**
    - All clients must complete strict KYC/KYB verification using trusted third-party tools (e.g., "toggle").
    - Required information includes real-name identity, GitHub, and Slack accounts.
2. **Enterprise Client Requirements:**
    - Enterprise clients must provide a business license, authorization letter, and sample data.
    - Additional verification of organizational structure and key stakeholders.
3. **Sybil Attack Mitigation:**
    - Rate limits and allocation caps are enforced.
    - Each identity is checked to avoid duplicate or fake applications.
4. **Audit Readiness:**
    - All verification materials and procedures are documented and available for governance audits.

## Description of Data Diligence

Our data diligence ensures legal compliance and data authenticity:

1. **Business Scope and Ownership Verification:**
    - Use third-party KYB services to confirm enterprise legitimacy.
    - Clients provide supporting documents and data ownership proof.
2. **Legal Compliance:**
    - Regional and local data regulations are reviewed for every client.
    - Legal documentation and client commitments are required.
3. **Data Sampling & Verification:**
    - Clients must submit data samples during application.
    - We use tools (e.g., lassie,boost, CID Checker) to randomly verify stored data matches client claims.
4. **Audit Trail:**
    - All diligence actions, CID sampling records, and verification evidence are logged and retrievable for audits.
